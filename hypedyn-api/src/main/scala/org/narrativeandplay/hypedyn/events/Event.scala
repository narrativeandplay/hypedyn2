/**
 * A generic trait representing an event in the HypeDyn event system
 *
 * HypeDyn relies almost entirely on events to communicate between different layers of the application.
 * The main event flow is as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Request -> Response -> Action -> Completion
 * </pre>
 *
 * The UI or a plugin would generate a `Request`; the core would generate the appropriate `Response`; the UI or plugin
 * would perform some action/computation and generate an `Action`; the core would perform a resulting action and
 * generate the appropriate `Completion`
 *
